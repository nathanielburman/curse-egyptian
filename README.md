# curse-egyptian
A spicy curse.

Beware! Of this Curse!

They said the evil curse:
“Butt Fuck Egypt”

This is their curse to bury.

Anyone who said this curse is cursed. This is an ancient land. You are morons beyond compare.

The curse you unleashed upon yourselves with the blood of tyrants and pharaohs.

Egyptians are not homosexual and speaking of Egypt in this way is unholy, unsacred, and evil.

Only homosexuals can now speak the curse:
“Butt Fuck Egypt”
